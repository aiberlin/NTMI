Permissions


You will have to set the permissions with udev to be correct, create a file in the folder: /etc/udev/rules.d/, and name it (e.g.) 90-hidraw-permissions.rules

In the file, you will need this line:

KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"

This will give read and write permissions to hidraw-devices to users that are in the plugdev group on your system.

To check whether you belong to that group execute the command groups in the terminal.

After you have added the udev rules file, you can access the device after plugging and replugging the device.

You can change the permission manually (as root) from the terminal with the command:
sudo chmod 664 /dev/hidraw*
sudo chgrp plugdev /dev/hidraw*
Check the permissions with:
"ls /dev/hidraw* -lah".unixCmd;
