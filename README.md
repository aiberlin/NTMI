# NTMI

This repo contains the full setup for the Nontrivial Music Instrument (NTMI) by Airborne Instruments. 

The code is all written in SuperCollider, and can be loaded from the SuperCollider IDE; 
for better access to users with little interest in coding, it is also packaged in (platform specific, OSX, Linux, Raspi, Win) Standalone apps made with SuperCollider.
