# NTMI

This repo contains the full setup for the Nontrivial Music Instrument (NTMI) by Airborne Instruments.
The code is all in SuperCollider, and can be loaded from the SuperCollider IDE; for better access to 
users with little interest in coding, it is also packaged in Standalone apps made with SuperCollider.
